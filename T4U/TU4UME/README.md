UML2JSON Transformation: it is the EPSILON-based transformation that generates the Java-based UML2JSON Tool. It contains the BTS example as source model, plus the UML profiles required to annotate the Cloud/IoT Infrastructure concepts on that model. 
The transformation takes as input both the UML Model and all the applied profiles and generate 
1) a Java-based API from profiles to generate IoT/Cloud objects (e.g. new VirtualSensor()) and 2) a Java Main class that builds the BTS example using that Java API

Thanks to Google GSON Library, the runtime objects are serialized in JSON.
It is worth noting that the design rationale behind 1) is using pojo Java classes so that the runtime object are simple and their serialization in JSON can be customized. 
Existing Java API for UML Models and Profiles (e.g. Eclipse EMF provided by Eclipse) are too complex and, then, the JSON serialization hard to customize and read.
