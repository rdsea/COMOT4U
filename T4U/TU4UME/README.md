# TU4UME

**UML2JSON Transformation**: it is the EPSILON-based transformation that generates the Java-based UML2JSON Tool. It contains the BTS example as source model, plus the UML profiles required to annotate the Cloud/IoT Infrastructure concepts on that model. 

The transformation takes as input both the *UML Model* and all the applied *profiles* and generate 
    - a **Java-based API from profiles** to generate IoT/Cloud objects (e.g. new VirtualSensor()) 
    - a **Java Main class** that builds the BTS example **using that Java API**

Thanks to **Google GSON Library**, the runtime objects are correctly serialized in JSON.
It is worth noting that the design rationales TU4UME are 
- full control on UML2JSON transformation rules
- generation of POJO Java classes to instantiate runtime objects with a simple structure to obtain a easy-to-read serialization in JSON. 
Alternative, existing solution (e.g., EMF2JSON https://github.com/emfjson/emfjson-jackson) that serialize EMF-based Java objects are too complex, with limited customization.
