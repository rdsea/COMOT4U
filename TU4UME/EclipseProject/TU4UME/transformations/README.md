# TU4UME

This folder contains the transformation algorithms implemented through the EPSILON Tool.
Further information about EPSILON is available here https://eclipse.org/epsilon/

The transformation algorithm are implemented using the following transformation languages from EPSILON:

** UML2JAVA (model2text transformation), INPUT UML(.uml), OUTPUT: JavaSource Code (.java): **
We generate the Java source code from  InstanceSpecification element that represent IoT and Cloud infrastructural elements as indentified by stereotype annotations (e.g., <<CloudService>>, <<VirtualSensor>>, <<Actuator>>, and so on).

EGX (.egx) scripts define rules that invoke to EGL templates. EGL templates are textual documents that mix static text (of any kind) with dynamic parts (written as .eol code snippets). In order to generate Java source code files using EGL/EGX, the static part of EGL files corresponds to Java source code fragments while the dynamic part are EOL code snipperts invoking ad-hoc, profile-specific EOL libraries that access the elements of the source UML Model and their annotations.
The ad-hoc, profile-specific EOL libraries that are generated via the Tool Tuning steps. 

** Tool Tuning (model2text transformation), INPUT UML Profile(.profile.uml), OUTPUT: EOL Libraries (.eol): **: 
Profile-specific libraries suitably extend our TU4UME tool. 
They evolve together with the UML Profile (profile.uml) and have to be regenerated when the corresponding UML profile changes. EOL Libraries are automatically generated for each UML Profile applied to the source UML Model. We adopt EPSILON EGL/EGX to automatically generate new EOL libraries. In that case both static and dynamic parts of EGL files are EOL code fragments.

** JAVA2JSON: JSON output obtained by the Google GSON Library **
The JSON serialization is obtained by executing the main Java Class that generate the Java Objects from the Java APIs generated for each UML Profile applied to the source UML Model.

**Launchers**
EPSILON scripts that lauch model tranformations
POJO_InfrastructureCPSProfile_Gen.launch generates the Java Classes for the InfrastructureCPS Profile that are imported by the SystemModel.java main java file

POJO_MARTE_Gen.launch generates the Java Classes for the MARTE Profile that are imported by the SystemModel.java main java file

SystemModel_BTS_InstanceSpecifications_Gen.launch generates the System Model main Java file. The JSON output is generated by executing the output of this transformation.
