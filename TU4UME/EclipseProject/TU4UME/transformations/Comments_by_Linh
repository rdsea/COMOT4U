i have to read. because i think generating docker file is for preparing elements 
(so it is good when we dont have elements in the repository) 
but if we have then we dont need. 
so maybe it will be useful for the future work.

the flow is: from model -[extraction tool]-> json -[configuration and generation tool]-> 
(i)docker files if needed, 
(ii)yaml - [deployment tool] --> 
so we need to separate extraction tool from configuration and generation tool to enable flexbility
i think let us focus on figures 5 and 6, section 4.1 (extract information from models), 
and section 5.1 (explain the use cases).
it means we complete the first version of "extraction tool", 
then we will focus on the "configuration/generation tool" for yml 
(we do not focus on generating Docker file in this paper - 
you can use it for the sinc model in the future)
